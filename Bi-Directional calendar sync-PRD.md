LFE: Bi-directional Calendar Sync PRD
1. Problem Statement & Goals

Problem

Users currently face friction when managing their calendar events across Cal.com and Google Calendar. When they modify events in Google Calendar, these changes don't reflect in Cal.com, leading to potential scheduling conflicts and manual work to keep both systems in sync.


Goals

* Reduce manual work for users managing events across platforms
* Minimize scheduling conflicts caused by out-of-sync calendars
* Improve user confidence in their calendar management
* Lay foundation for future calendar provider integrations

Success Metrics

* 90% success rate for sync operations
* Sync operations complete within 5 seconds
* Reduction in support tickets related to calendar sync issues
* Positive feedback from internal team testing

2. User Stories

Primary User: Team Admin

* As a team admin, I want to enable bi-directional sync for my team so that calendar changes are automatically reflected
* As a team admin, I want to see which calendars are being synced so I can manage my team's calendar connections
* As a team admin, I want to disable sync if issues arise so I can prevent potential problems

Primary User: Team Member

* As a team member, I want my Google Calendar changes to automatically reflect in Cal.com so I don't have to make changes twice
* As a team member, I want to move events in Google Calendar and have them update in Cal.com so I can manage my schedule flexibly
* As a team member, I want to delete events in Google Calendar and have them cancel in Cal.com so I don't have to manage cancellations separately

3. Functional Requirements

Core Features

* Automatic sync of time/date changes from Google Calendar to Cal.com
* Automatic sync of event deletions from Google Calendar to Cal.com
* Support for all selected calendars in user's Google Calendar account
* Handling of recurring events as individual instances

User Experience

* Clear indication of which calendars are being synced
* Immediate reflection of changes (within 5 seconds)
* No user intervention required for sync operations
* Graceful handling of conflicts and edge cases

Edge Cases

* Past events and past-dated changes are ignored
* Description changes are ignored
* Duplicate events across calendars are handled appropriately
* Calendar moves are handled when possible

4. Technical Requirements

Integration Points

* Google Calendar API for event updates
* Webhook system for change notifications
* Cal.com booking system for updates
* Feature flag system for team-level control

Performance Requirements

* Sync operations under 5 seconds
* Rate limiting to prevent abuse (2 updates per minute per event)
* Retry mechanism for failed syncs (up to 3 attempts)
* System admin notifications for failures

Security & Privacy

* Only sync events created in Cal.com
* Respect existing user availability settings
* Maintain data privacy across integrations
* Secure handling of calendar credentials

5. Implementation Phases

Phase 1: Basic Sync (MVP)

* Time/date change sync
* Event deletion sync
* Basic webhook handling
* Internal team testing

Phase 2: Enhanced Features

* Title update sync
* Improved error handling
* Enhanced monitoring
* Beta testing with select teams

Phase 3: Future Expansion

* Outlook Calendar integration
* Additional calendar providers
* Advanced conflict resolution
* User preferences for sync behavior

Ah yes, let me complete the PRD with the remaining sections:


6. Risks & Mitigations

Technical Risks

* Webhook failures
* Mitigation: Retry mechanism and admin notifications
* Sync conflicts
* Mitigation: Clear rules for handling conflicts
* Performance issues
* Mitigation: Rate limiting and monitoring

User Experience Risks

* Unexpected cancellations
* Mitigation: Clear documentation and team admin controls
* Sync delays

* Mitigation: Clear UI indicators and documentation

Rollback Plan

* Criteria for disabling feature:
* Abnormal cancellation rates
* Increased support tickets
* Performance issues
* Process:
* Toggle off global feature flag
* Notify affected teams
* Monitor for resolution
* In-progress syncs will be ignored during rollback

* Feature enablement/disablement for teams
* Global toggle in admin settings
* Clear explanation of sync behavior
* Troubleshooting guide

Technical Documentation

* README file explaining implementation
* Webhook handling process
* Event tracking and comparison logic
* API integration details

Monitoring Requirements

* Logging of webhook-triggered actions
* System admin notifications for failures
* Success rate monitoring
* Performance metrics tracking
* Alert thresholds for:
* Sync failure rates
* Performance degradation
* Unusual cancellation patterns
