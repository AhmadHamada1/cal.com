# Migration Safety Improvements

## Pre-Migration Tasks

1. **Create Backup**

   - [ ] Create a backup of the EventType table
   - [ ] Create a backup of the \_user_eventtype table
   - [ ] Document the backup locations and verification process

2. **Validation Checks**

   - [ ] Verify all user IDs in \_user_eventtype exist in users table
   - [ ] Check for potential unique constraint violations on [userId, slug]
   - [ ] Identify any orphaned records in \_user_eventtype
   - [ ] Document any data inconsistencies found

3. **Performance Planning**
   - [ ] Analyze table sizes to determine if batching is needed
   - [ ] Create necessary indexes for the join operation
   - [ ] Plan batch sizes if needed
   - [ ] Document expected execution time

## Migration Implementation

1. **Transaction Setup**

   - [ ] Wrap the entire migration in a transaction
   - [ ] Add error handling and rollback logic
   - [ ] Implement logging of transaction status

2. **Data Validation**

   - [ ] Add checks for user existence before updates
   - [ ] Implement validation for unique constraints
   - [ ] Add checks for data consistency between tables

3. **Update Logic**

   - [ ] Implement batching if needed
   - [ ] Add progress logging
   - [ ] Include record counts before and after
   - [ ] Add verification steps after each batch

4. **Rollback Plan**
   - [ ] Create rollback SQL script
   - [ ] Document rollback procedure
   - [ ] Test rollback process
   - [ ] Add rollback triggers for specific error conditions

## Post-Migration Tasks

1. **Verification**

   - [ ] Verify all expected records were updated
   - [ ] Check for any constraint violations
   - [ ] Validate data consistency
   - [ ] Document verification results

2. **Cleanup**

   - [ ] Remove temporary indexes if created
   - [ ] Archive backup data
   - [ ] Update documentation with migration results

3. **Monitoring**
   - [ ] Set up monitoring for any post-migration issues
   - [ ] Document monitoring period
   - [ ] Create alert conditions if needed

## Documentation

1. **Migration Documentation**

   - [ ] Document the purpose of the migration
   - [ ] Record all changes made
   - [ ] Document any issues encountered
   - [ ] Update schema documentation

2. **Runbook**
   - [ ] Create detailed runbook for the migration
   - [ ] Include all verification steps
   - [ ] Document rollback procedures
   - [ ] Add troubleshooting guide

## Testing

1. **Pre-Production Testing**

   - [ ] Test in development environment
   - [ ] Test in staging environment
   - [ ] Document test results
   - [ ] Address any issues found

2. **Dry Run**
   - [ ] Perform dry run in production
   - [ ] Verify expected changes
   - [ ] Document dry run results
   - [ ] Adjust plan based on results
