# Migration Safety Improvements

## Pre-Migration Tasks

1. **Create Backup**

   - [x] Create a backup of the EventType table
   - [x] Create a backup of the \_user_eventtype table
   - [x] Document the backup locations and verification process

2. **Validation Checks**

   - [x] Verify all user IDs in \_user_eventtype exist in users table
   - [x] Check for potential unique constraint violations on [userId, slug]
   - [x] Identify any orphaned records in \_user_eventtype
   - [x] Document any data inconsistencies found

3. **Performance Planning**
   - [x] Analyze table sizes to determine if batching is needed
   - [x] Create necessary indexes for the join operation
   - [x] Plan batch sizes if needed
   - [x] Document expected execution time

## Migration Implementation

1. **Transaction Setup**

   - [x] Wrap the entire migration in a transaction
   - [x] Add error handling and rollback logic
   - [x] Implement logging of transaction status

2. **Data Validation**

   - [x] Add checks for user existence before updates
   - [x] Implement validation for unique constraints
   - [x] Add checks for data consistency between tables

3. **Update Logic**

   - [x] Implement batching if needed
   - [x] Add progress logging
   - [x] Include record counts before and after
   - [x] Add verification steps after each batch

4. **Rollback Plan**
   - [x] Create rollback SQL script
   - [x] Document rollback procedure
   - [x] Test rollback process
   - [x] Add rollback triggers for specific error conditions

## Post-Migration Tasks

1. **Verification**

   - [x] Verify all expected records were updated
   - [x] Check for any constraint violations
   - [x] Validate data consistency
   - [x] Document verification results

2. **Cleanup**

   - [x] Remove temporary indexes if created
   - [x] Archive backup data
   - [x] Update documentation with migration results

3. **Monitoring**
   - [x] Set up monitoring for any post-migration issues
   - [x] Document monitoring period
   - [x] Create alert conditions if needed

## Documentation

1. **Migration Documentation**

   - [x] Document the purpose of the migration
   - [x] Record all changes made
   - [x] Document any issues encountered
   - [x] Update schema documentation

2. **Runbook**
   - [x] Create detailed runbook for the migration
   - [x] Include all verification steps
   - [x] Document rollback procedures
   - [x] Add troubleshooting guide

## Testing

1. **Pre-Production Testing**

   - [x] Test in development environment
   - [x] Test in staging environment
   - [x] Document test results
   - [x] Address any issues found

2. **Dry Run**
   - [x] Perform dry run in production
   - [x] Verify expected changes
   - [x] Document dry run results
   - [x] Adjust plan based on results
