3. **Maintained backward compatibility**: All existing CSS variable references preserved
4. **Created v4 theme configuration**: New `theme.css` file with `@theme` directive
5. **Simplified preset configuration**: Reduced complexity while maintaining functionality

## Custom Plugins Status

All custom plugins in the preset are compatible with v4:
- OS-specific variants (mac, windows, ios)
- Base styles for hr elements
- Enabled variant for form elements

## Recommendations

1. **Monitor plugin updates**: Watch for v4-compatible versions of `@savvywombat/tailwindcss-grid-areas` and `tailwindcss-animate`
2. **Consider alternatives**: Evaluate native CSS Grid and CSS animations as alternatives
3. **Test thoroughly**: Verify all existing functionality works correctly with current plugin versions
4. **Update when available**: Upgrade to v4-compatible versions when released by maintainers

## Risk Assessment

- **Low Risk**: Most plugins are compatible or officially maintained
- **Medium Risk**: 2 plugins may need future updates but currently functional
- **Mitigation**: All critical functionality preserved through CSS variables and custom utilities

## Next Steps

1. Monitor CI checks for any plugin-related issues
2. Test visual components that use grid areas and animations
3. Set up monitoring for plugin updates
4. Consider contributing to plugin maintenance if needed
