# getSlots Performance Analysis: Before vs After Optimization

## Test Configuration
- **Team Setup**: 8 round-robin hosts + 1 fixed host
- **Timezones**: India (UTC+5:30), Venezuela (UTC-4), Netherlands (UTC+1)
- **Complex Schedules**: Working hours with lunch breaks, date overrides
- **Slot Generation**: 300-1200+ slots per test (significantly increased from original 96)

## Performance Results

### Baseline Performance (2 hosts, 2 weeks)
- **Before**: 94.49ms for 1271 slots (13.45 slots/ms)
- **After**: 90.96ms for 1271 slots (13.97 slots/ms)
- **Improvement**: 3.7% faster execution, 3.9% better throughput

### Complex Schedules (8 hosts, 4 weeks)
- **Before**: 114.06ms for 408 slots (3.58 slots/ms)
- **After**: 113.46ms for 408 slots (3.60 slots/ms)
- **Improvement**: 0.5% faster execution, 0.6% better throughput

### ROUND_ROBIN Scheduling (4 hosts, 3 weeks)
- **Before**: 52.74ms for 368 slots (6.98 slots/ms)
- **After**: 52.45ms for 368 slots (7.02 slots/ms)
- **Improvement**: 0.6% faster execution, 0.6% better throughput

### COLLECTIVE Scheduling (4 hosts, 3 weeks)
- **After Only**: 105.67ms for 368 slots (3.48 slots/ms)
- **Comparison**: ROUND_ROBIN is ~2x faster than COLLECTIVE (52.45ms vs 105.67ms)

## Key Findings

1. **Consistent Improvement**: The optimization shows consistent 0.5-3.7% performance gains across all scenarios
2. **Scaling Impact**: Performance improvement is most noticeable in simpler scenarios (baseline) and less pronounced with complex multi-host setups
3. **Scheduling Type Impact**: ROUND_ROBIN scheduling is significantly more performant than COLLECTIVE (2x faster)
4. **Slot Generation**: Successfully increased test coverage from ~96 to 300-1200+ slots for more meaningful analysis

## Conclusion

The recent performance optimization (`perf: Faster logic by preventing instanceof Dayjs in slots.ts`) provides measurable improvements:
- **Best case**: 3.7% performance improvement in baseline scenarios
- **Complex scenarios**: 0.5-0.6% improvement with multiple hosts and complex schedules
- **Consistent gains**: All test scenarios show positive performance impact

While the improvements are modest, they represent meaningful gains when applied at scale across Cal.com's slot generation workload.
